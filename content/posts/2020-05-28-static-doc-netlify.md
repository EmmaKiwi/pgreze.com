Recently I was playing with a new [Kotlin project](https://github.com/pgreze/kounter) trying to bring some Python goodness into Kotlin.
After created the first POC, refactored until something releasable merged, and figured out *one more time* how maven publishing is working, it was finally time to share it to the world.

But this project is just bringing a concept, and many extension functions in order to facilitate its usage with native types.
So, even if I'm a big fan of exaustive READMEs, I was looking for a more complete documentation.

This is the story of how I could plug together:

- Dokka
- ~~Github Pages~~ Netlify
- Github Actions

And at the end have an easy to build documentation, refreshed everytime a new version is published.

‚ö†Ô∏è All examples are using a project named **kounter**. Replace all occurences with your own project name!!

## Dokka

As a natural choice, [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka) is **THE** documentation engine for Kotlin and so was the tool I used.
Seems like they're also fans of exhaustive READMEs because all my questions were answered pretty quickly by reading it, but for you I will summarize what's important to know when using it.

First of all, Dokka has different ways to generate documentation.
In my case, only 3 were really interesting:

- `html` - minimalistic html format used by default, Java classes are translated to Kotlin
- `javadoc` - looks like normal Javadoc, Kotlin classes are translated to Java
- `html-as-java` - looks like `html`, but Kotlin classes are translated to Java

{{< image src="/assets/2020-05-28-static-doc-netlify/html.png" position="center" >}}
*html output is minimalist but quite useful for a Kotlin user.*

{{< image src="/assets/2020-05-28-static-doc-netlify/javadoc.png" position="center" >}}
*javadoc is bare to the metal. Probably good for a Java centric corporate project.*

{{< image src="/assets/2020-05-28-static-doc-netlify/html-as-java.png" position="center" >}}
*if you like javadoc and blue colors.*

After having chosen which format you prefer, here is time to include Dokka in your Gradle setup:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id 'org.jetbrains.dokka' version '0.10.1'
}

tasks.dokka {
    outputFormat = "html"
    outputDirectory = "$buildDir/dokka"
    configuration {
        sourceLink {
            // URL showing where the source code can be accessed through the web browser
            url = "https://github.com/pgreze/kounter/tree/${tagVersion ?: "master"}/"
            // Suffix which is used to append the line number to the URL. Use #L for GitHub
            lineSuffix = "#L"
        }
    }
}
```

The **sourceLink** block is allowing to jump from documentation to Github source code.
The `tagVersion ?: "master"` instruction is injecting the next available version during its publication or fallback to master branch for local development.
Please see [the project Gradle setup](https://github.com/pgreze/kounter/blob/76fb78ecf338bf84d6cb5054342a4bc4319055d7/build.gradle.kts#L14) for a complete example.

After all this setup, generate your first documentation is as easy as using:

```
$ ./gradlew :dokka
$ tree -L 2 build/dokka/
build/dokka/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kounter
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alltypes
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ com.github.pgreze.kollections
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index-outline.html
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package-list
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css
$ open build/dokka/kounter/index.html # Open in your browser (OSX)
```

But as you noticed, this project is including only 1 module,
and generated HTML are using a *style.css* located one folder above the single module one.

To facilitate future operations, it would be nice to:
- move this *style.css* file in the *build/dokka/kounter* folder and
- rewrite all HTML files to reference the new location.

Thanks to Gradle Kotlin DSL, it's really easy to create a custom task *finalizing* the dokka task with those  last minutes edits:

```kotlin
val moveCss by tasks.registering {
    description = "Move style.css in kounter folder (distribution friendly)."
    fun File.rewriteStyleLocations() {
        readText().replace("../style.css", "style.css")
            .also { writeText(it) }
    }
    fun File.recursivelyRewriteStyleLocations() {
        list()?.map(this::resolve)?.forEach {
            if (it.isDirectory) it.recursivelyRewriteStyleLocations() else it.rewriteStyleLocations()
        }
    }
    doLast {
        val dokkaOutputDirectory = file(tasks.dokka.get().outputDirectory)
        val kounterFolder = dokkaOutputDirectory.resolve("kounter")
        kounterFolder.recursivelyRewriteStyleLocations()
        dokkaOutputDirectory.resolve("style.css").also {
            it.renameTo(kounterFolder.resolve(it.name))
        }
    }
}
tasks.dokka {
    // ...
    finalizedBy(moveCss)
}
```

And so without changing our gradle task execution, we could slightly change 
the generated documentation to fit our needs üëç

## Publish to Netlify

Our goal was to have an easy to use documentation, but its still only available locally.
Dokka generating HTML static files, we're missing a place to serve them **for free**.

**Github Pages** was the way to go when I first started writing this blog,
but nowadays [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/) 
is the way to go:
- Deploy Previews ü§©
- Compatible with all Static Site Generators ü§©
- ~~Sponsor [@cassidoo](https://twitter.com/cassidoo) to bring joy in our lifes~~

I was thinking Netlify was only [consuming a git repository](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/), the same way Github Pages is working.
But there's also a [command line client](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/)
allowing to publish a bunch of files as a website (similar to [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)).

Before using it in your CI, you need to create a new site locally:

```
$ netlify login
$ netlify deploy -d build/dokka/kounter
```

The first deploy will allow you to create a new site, choose a name for it, etc.
After doing so, you can start deploying the first version with:

```
netlify deploy -d build/dokka/kounter --prod
```

You can now access your fresh new [dokka documentation online](https://kounter.netlify.app/) üéâ

## Publish for every new releases

As for all my new open source projects, I'm using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to [publish a new release](https://github.com/pgreze/kounter/blob/76fb78ecf338bf84d6cb5054342a4bc4319055d7/.github/workflows/publish.yml) every time I create a new release/tag in my repository.

Netlify is providing a [Github Action](https://github.com/netlify/actions/tree/master/cli) to use
their command line application in a workflow.
My setup is [pretty simple](https://github.com/pgreze/kounter/blob/76fb78ecf338bf84d6cb5054342a4bc4319055d7/.github/workflows/publish.yml#L41):

```yaml
      - name: Generate Dokka
        run: ./gradlew :dokka
      - name: Publish Dokka
        uses: netlify/actions/cli@master
        with:
          args: deploy --dir=build/dokka/kounter --prod
        env:
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
```

I found **NETLIFY_SITE_ID** in the `.netlify/state.json` file created after I deployed the first version locally, and a new **NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN** can be generated in the [Netlify UI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#obtain-a-token-in-the-netlify-ui).

And about [Github secrets setup](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets), that's something you probably learned quickly after starting using Github Actions.
