## [Keynote by Jeff Atwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eymphDN7No4)

Learning from failure is the best
Books:
- bad blood
- postmortem from game developers

to learn from mistakes -> take notes

safety system test?

## [Project Updates + Q&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXhmRal9TsA)

Based in Munich + some in the valley

https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk == gradlew
https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark new name for Bazel language
https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external for maven migration

https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-bench performance tracking tool
build profiler compatible with Chrome DevTools
bazel aquery -> query actions

Android rules were rewritten from Java to Starlark
https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_kotlin maintained by https://github.com/cgruber in Square

A lot of questions about roadmaps, seems like it's difficult to adopt Bazel ideally 
if there's no idea when specific things will be improved/things.

## [Building Self Driving Cars with Bazel in BMW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh4SJuYUoQI)

23M LOC
2k developers
20k CI builds per day
C++, Python, C, Shell, Java, Go
Cloud based CI
virtual mono-repo

why they take Bazel:
- Sandbox built in (privacy rules)
- incremental builds, no clean, tests are cached and executed incrementally
- frozen dependency management

Remote caching working awesome but remote execution hard to setup, they're using https://github.com/buildbarn

they're using git-submodules to have like a mono-repo
CI build always against HEAD of all repos (--> no delayed integration)
CI build everything (90% is cached)
they use Zuul (by OpenStack) support dependant merging of PR from diff. repos

## [Six learnings in moving to a Bazel-based CI system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYg3fDFrTz8)

WIX CI
5M LOC +1K repos 2k+ maven modules
push to feedback 5/10 mn
release few hours

Use a migration tool for easy migration, like:
Easily migrate your JVM code from Maven to Bazel: https://github.com/wix/exodus

local dev != CI, monitor both to know if yoou didn't break one
keep the old CI so you can migrate when ready

to have smooth migration, they migrated 50 repos smoothly. I have 1 internal dep:
- is it migrated? Consume source, otherwise consume maven binary

## [Lessons from Our First 100,000 Bazel Builds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keT8ixRS6Fk)

Slides and notes: http://bit.ly/hungrybazel
By Kevin Gessner, Etsy.

Advise: start to learn about migration key points.

Transitive dependencies has to be resolved, its a pain by hand...
They're using a maven->bazel script: https://github.com/johnynek/bazel-deps
but should be replaced by the official maven rules.

More bazel granularities -> more parallelism.

Circular dependencies are not possible, so clean them gradually...

For easy use, write wrapper that people can be familiar:
- build.sh for ./gradlew build
- runTests.sh for ./gradlew test
and so migrate to bazel internally is easy.

A .bazelversion file +  bazelisk + in build:

```python
versions.check(
    minimum_bazel_version="1.0.0"
)
```

remote cache is awesome but not easy to setup,
but awesome for any artifacts, even test results.

About their deployment, they're using:
- http://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless for their docker images runtime,
- Python/Bazel based YAML generation tools to setup QA/prod environments,
- https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_k8s to glue images+YAML

Starlark is scary http://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/aspects.html
it's hard to learn BUT worth it.
genrules is magic glue for sticking things together.

## [Migrating Lyft-iOS to Bazel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAPeWoimGx8)

TODO

## [Gradle to Bazel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uR7_vReQ0)

Dockerfile is better in Bazel, working in // and hermetic

Bazel cannot publish maven artifacts, there's community rules:
https://github.com/graknlabs/bazel-distribution

Gradle:
- Spotbugs (Findbugs successor)
- PMD
- checkstyle

Bazel:
- Error Prone
- https://github.com/Zetten/bazel-sonarqube

Gradle evolved with Plugins and custom tasks
Bazel with rules, tool chains and platforms
